It's one of version of my code.
The version is no longer supported, it works a LITTLE (the difference is a little more than a second per song on average) faster than the main one due to the simplicity of its implementation, but it is not safe due to the possible errors that it may produce. This version does not attempt to fix the age restriction bug or other issues.
